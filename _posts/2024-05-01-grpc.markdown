**api** 

- send request (client)
- send answer (server)

**grpc** 

- lets you define **request** and **response** for RPC (remote procedure calls) and handles the rest for you
- remote procedure call: request a service from a program located on another computer without needing to understand the networkâ€™s details
- language independent

how? 

- we use protocol buffers (.proto) , whcih generate code. data is binary and serialized (transmit an object into bytes)
- protocol buffers data sizes are way more compact than json
- json: 50 bytes for the same object 25 bytes
