Trying to learn Bevy 2 days after picking up Rust. Let's see how this goes !!! 

Their home page calls Bevy "refeshingly simple" lol.

Bevy implements an Entity Component System rather than traditional Object-Oriented Programing 

3 things:
Entity 
Component 
Systems 

Componenet: 
```rust
#[derive(Component)] 
struct Position {x: f32, y: f32}

#[derive(Component)]
struct Velocity {x: f32, y: f32 }
```
This entire block of code below is a System. 
```rust 
fn spawn_spaceship(mut commands: Commands) {
  commands.spawn((
    Position {x: 0.0, y:, 0.0} // entity 
    Velocity{x: 1/0, y:1.0} // entity 
  ));
}

```

"Data is stored in components and behavior in systems."
